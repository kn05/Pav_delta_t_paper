# Temporal Pavlovian Conditioning of a Model Spiking Neural Network for Discrimination of Short Time Intervals

This repository contains the code used to generate data for the paper:

**"Temporal Pavlovian Conditioning of a Model Spiking Neural Network for Discrimination of Short Time Intervals"**

The simulation focuses on generating data for triplet stimuli using a spiking neural network model based on Izhikevich neurons. The code is adapted from the [`izhikevich_pavlovian` example](https://github.com/BrainsOnBoard/pygenn_paper) in the `pygenn_paper` repository.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment and run the simulations, please follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.9.16** if it's not already installed on your system.

2. **Install PyGeNN version 4.8.1**:

   - Follow the installation instructions provided in the PyGeNN documentation: [PyGeNN Installation Guide](https://genn-team.github.io/genn/documentation/4/html/d8/d99/Installation.html)

3. **Install Veusz** for plotting (optional, only if you wish to use the provided plotting scripts):

   - Download and install Veusz from [https://veusz.github.io/](https://veusz.github.io/).

## Dependencies

- **Python**: Version 3.9.16
- **PyGeNN**: Version 4.8.1 ([Installation Guide](https://genn-team.github.io/genn/documentation/4/html/d8/d99/Installation.html))
- **Veusz**: For data visualization ([Veusz Website](https://veusz.github.io/))
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running `plotting.ipynb`

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Simulation

After setting up the environment, you can generate data by using one of the following methods:

1. **Generate Data for a Single Time Interval**:

   ```bash
   python izhikevich_pavlovian_gpu_stim.py
   ```

   - This command runs the simulation for the default time interval and generates the data.

**OR**

2. **Run Simulations for Multiple Time Intervals**:

   ```bash
   bash script.sh
   ```

   - This script automates simulations across various time intervals.

### Plotting the Results

1. **Process and Visualize Data**:

   - Open the Jupyter Notebook:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook plotting.ipynb
     ```

   - Run the cells in `plotting.ipynb` to process the data and generate plots.

2. **View Plots**:

   - The plots will be saved in the `fig/` directory.
   - You can also view them directly within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Availability

- The data required for analysis is generated by running `izhikevich_pavlovian_gpu_stim.py` or `script.sh`.
- Users need to run one of the simulation scripts to produce the data.
- Pre-generated data is not included in the repository.
